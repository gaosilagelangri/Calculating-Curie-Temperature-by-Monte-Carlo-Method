Calculating Curie temperature is a skill that must be mastered in magnetic theory research.
But this is in fact not difficult and requires some modelling and algorithms to solve.

This work is based on PhD.Liang Liu's **MCSOLVER** Procedures,that is a great and easy project.
You can get more information by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/golddoushi/mcsolver).
I will then give two small examples and describe their use（This is with his own permission）.
