# Calculating-Curie-Temperature-by-Monte-Carlo-Method

To calculate the Curie temperature it is in fact only necessary to know the following parameters：

+ J
+ D
+ Direction
+ Patience

My Enlightenment [Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jZ4y1T7Ds?from=search&seid=6713171886036134943)，The downside is that the video has no sound and is not detailed enough, but it solves a lot of problems！Thanks lot for it.

I use Monte Carlo Method to calculate and use the Open Source Programs [**MCSOLVER**](https://github.com/golddoushi/mcsolver)!I discussed its use with its author（PhD.Liang Liu） and became familiar with its use!Following,I'll explain the usage in detail！

Usually I start by editing all the parameters under Windows，then I exported the input file to run under Linux.
